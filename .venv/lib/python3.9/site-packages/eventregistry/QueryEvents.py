        Query class for searching for events in the Event Registry.
        The resulting events have to match all specified conditions. If a parameter value equals "" or [], then it is ignored.
        In order for query to be valid, it has to have at least one positive condition (condition that does not start with ignore*).

        @param keywords: find events where articles mention all the specified keywords.
            A single keyword/phrase can be provided as a string, multiple keywords/phrases can be provided as a list of strings.
            Use QueryItems.AND() if *all* provided keywords/phrases should be mentioned, or QueryItems.OR() if *any* of the keywords/phrases should be mentioned.
        @param conceptUri: find events where the concept with concept uri is important.
            A single concept uri can be provided as a string, multiple concept uris can be provided as a list of strings.
            Use QueryItems.AND() if *all* provided concepts should be mentioned, or QueryItems.OR() if *any* of the concepts should be mentioned.
            To obtain a concept uri using a concept label use EventRegistry.getConceptUri().

            A single category uri can be provided as a string, multiple category uris can be provided as a list of strings.
            Use QueryItems.AND() if *all* provided categories should be mentioned, or QueryItems.OR() if *any* of the categories should be mentioned.
            A category uri can be obtained from a category name using EventRegistry.getCategoryUri().

            If multiple sources should be considered use QueryItems.OR() to provide the list of sources.

        @param sourceLocationUri: find events that contain one or more articles that were written by news sources located in the given geographic location.
            If multiple source locations are provided, then put them into a list inside QueryItems.OR()
            Location uri can either be a city or a country. Location uri for a given name can be obtained using EventRegistry.getLocationUri().
        @param sourceGroupUri: find events that contain one or more articles that were written by news sources that are assigned to the specified source group.
            If multiple source groups are provided, then put them into a list inside QueryItems.OR()
            Source group uri for a given name can be obtained using EventRegistry.getSourceGroupUri().

        @param lang: find events for which we found articles in the specified language.
            If more than one language is specified, resulting events has to be reported in *any* of the languages.
