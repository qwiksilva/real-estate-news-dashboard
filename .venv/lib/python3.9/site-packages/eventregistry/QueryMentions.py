        Query class for searching for individual mentions in the Event Registry.
        The resulting mentions (objects, containing sentence, article information, mentioned entities, etc.) have to match all specified conditions.
        If a parameter value equals "" or [], then it is ignored.
        In order for query to be valid, it has to have at least one positive condition (condition that does not start with ignore*).
        @param eventTypeUri: find mentions that express a certain type of a relation.
            A single event type can be provided as a string, multiple event types can be provided as a list of strings.
            Since each mention can only have one event type, if multiple event types are provided, an *or* condition is used between them.
        @param keywords: find mentions that mention the specified keywords.
            A single keyword/phrase can be provided as a string, multiple keywords/phrases can be provided as a list of strings.
            Use QueryItems.AND() if *all* provided keywords/phrases should be mentioned, or QueryItems.OR() if *any* of the keywords/phrases should be mentioned.
            or QueryItems.OR() to specify a list of keywords where any of the keywords have to appear
        @param conceptUri: find mentions where the concept with concept uri is mentioned.
            A single concept uri can be provided as a string, multiple concept uris can be provided as a list of strings.
            Use QueryItems.AND() if *all* provided concepts should be mentioned, or QueryItems.OR() if *any* of the concepts should be mentioned.
            To obtain a concept uri using a concept label use EventRegistry.getConceptUri().
        @param categoryUri: find mentions that are assigned into a particular category.
            A single category can be provided as a string, while multiple categories can be provided as a list in QueryItems.AND() or QueryItems.OR().
            A category uri can be obtained from a category name using EventRegistry.getCategoryUri().
        @param sourceUri: find mentions that were written by a news source sourceUri.
            If multiple sources should be considered use QueryItems.OR() to provide the list of sources.
            Source uri for a given news source name can be obtained using EventRegistry.getNewsSourceUri().
        @param sourceLocationUri: find mentions that were written by news sources located in the given geographic location.
            If multiple source locations are provided, then put them into a list inside QueryItems.OR().
            Location uri can either be a city or a country. Location uri for a given name can be obtained using EventRegistry.getLocationUri().
        @param sourceGroupUri: find mentions that were written by news sources that are assigned to the specified source group.
            If multiple source groups are provided, then put them into a list inside QueryItems.OR().
            Source group uri for a given name can be obtained using EventRegistry.getSourceGroupUri().
        @param industryUri: find mentions that relate to companies in a certain industry.
            A single industry can be provided as a string, while multiple industries can be provided as a list in QueryItems.AND() or QueryItems.OR().
            Industry uri for a given industry name can be obtained using EventRegistry.suggestIndustries().
        @param sdgUri: find mentions that are about event types that are associated with a particular SDG.
            If multiple SDGs are provided, then put them into a list inside QueryItems.OR().
            SDG uri for a given SDG can be obtained using EventRegistry.getSdgUris().
        @param sasbUri: find mentions that are about event types that are associated with a particular SASB category.
            If multiple SASB categories are provided, then put them into a list inside QueryItems.OR().
            SASB uri for a given SASB category can be obtained using EventRegistry.getSasbUris().
        @param esgUri: find mentions that are about event types that are associated with a particular ESG category.
            If multiple ESGs are provided, then put them into a list inside QueryItems.OR().
            Possible values are "esg/environment", "esg/social", "esg/governance".
        @param locationUri: find mentions that describe something that occurred at a particular location.
            If value can be a string or a list of strings provided in QueryItems.OR().

        @param endSourceRankPercentile: ending percentile of the sources to consider in the results (default: 100). Value should be in range 10-100 and divisible by 10.
        @param minSentiment: minimum value of the sentiment, that the returned mentions should have. Range [-1, 1]. Note: setting the value will remove all mentions that don't have
                a computed value for the sentiment (all non-English mentions)
        @param maxSentiment: maximum value of the sentiment, that the returned mentions should have. Range [-1, 1]. Note: setting the value will remove all mentions that don't have
